# Overview

Welcome to the Scotland Yard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Meta-Learning project! Inspired by the classic board game Scotland Yard, this project aims to develop a sophisticated multi-agent system where multiple guards collaboratively pursue a fleeing prisoner (Mr. X) within a dynamically weighted environment. Leveraging advanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and meta-learning techniques, our agents are designed to adapt swiftly to varying tasks and strategies, enhancing their pursuit efficiency and adaptability.

# Features

1. Multi-Agent Environment: Simulates a Scotland Yard-inspired grid with multiple guard agents and a single prisoner.
2. Weighted Graph: Incorporates a weighted graph structure to influence agent movements and strategies.
3. Advanced RL Agents: Implements RL algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
4. Meta-Learning Integration: Utilizes  Meta-Learning to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks.
5. Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive logging of training progress and performance metrics using TensorBoard.
6. Parallelization: Supports parallel execution of multiple environment instances for efficient training
